  main: |
    Serious anime illustration, tragic hospital scene emphasizing quiet despair and emptiness.
    CRITICAL: Vermillion's eyes must be OPEN, staring at nothing. Camera must be overhead/high angle.
    
    Camera Angle & Composition:
    - HIGH ANGLE / BIRD'S EYE VIEW (looking down at the bed from above)
    - NOT eye-level - camera is positioned ABOVE the scene
    - Focus on Vermillion lying in bed, seen from an elevated perspective
    - Granite should be at the EDGE of frame or partially visible (distance emphasized)
    
    Vermillion (Primary Focus):
    - Lying flat in hospital bed, sunken into mattress
    - Upper body slightly elevated by pillows, but clearly weak and listless
    - RIGHT ARM heavily bandaged (thick, multiple layers of wrapping)
    - Left arm at side, pale and thin
    - Face turned slightly toward ceiling (NOT looking at Granite)
    - EYES OPEN - critical detail:
      * Staring blankly at ceiling
      * Empty, hollow, lifeless gaze
      * No focus, no emotion
      * Like looking at nothing/through everything
    - Expression: completely emotionless void (NOT sad, NOT angry, just EMPTY)
    - Gaunt face, signs of weight loss
    - Red/auburn hair disheveled on pillow
    
    Granite (Secondary Element):
    - Standing at foot of bed OR edge of frame
    - Shown from behind or only partially (shoulder/back visible)
    - Creates sense of distance despite being in same room
    - Looking at Vermillion with pained expression (if visible)
    - Position emphasizes he is an outsider/visitor, not intimate
    
    Hospital Room Environment:
    - Sterile WHITE room (walls, sheets, equipment)
    - Medical equipment visible but not cluttered
    - Large window with HARSH white light streaming in
    - Window light creating blown-out whites (overexposed)
    - Deep shadows in corners (crushed blacks)
    - Minimal decoration - clinical coldness
    
    Lighting (CRITICAL):
    - Window light: HARSH, WHITE, almost painful
    - Creates extreme contrast (blown highlights, deep shadows)
    - NO warm tones - only cold whites, grays, blacks
    - White sheets almost glowing from harsh light
    - Shadows under Vermillion's eyes and cheekbones (gaunt appearance)
    - NO soft, gentle lighting
    
    Mood: tragic, void of hope, quiet despair, irreparable loss, emptiness
    Art style: serious anime, emphasis on EMPTY STARING EYES, clinical coldness, distance
    
    CRITICAL DETAILS TO AVOID:
    - Vermillion with eyes CLOSED (he must be staring blankly)
    - Vermillion looking AT Granite (he's looking at ceiling/nothing)
    - Eye-level camera angle (must be overhead)
    - Granite too close or prominent in frame
    - Warm, soft lighting
    - Emotional expression on Vermillion (anger/sadness) - only VOID
    - Healthy appearance
