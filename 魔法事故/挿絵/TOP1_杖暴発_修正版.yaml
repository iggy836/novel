# TOP1: Wand Explosion - REVISED
# ========================================
# Key improvement: Add MOTION and DYNAMISM
# The original was too static - needs action, impact, energy

top1_explosion_revised:
  scene_name: "Wand Explosion - The Moment of Tragedy"
  
  # ========================================
  # PROBLEM ANALYSIS (Original Image)
  # ========================================
  original_issues:
    - issue: "Static pose"
      problem: "Character just standing calmly"
      solution: "Add recoil, thrown-back pose, pain reaction"
    
    - issue: "Calm expression"
      problem: "Looks composed, not shocked"
      solution: "Wide eyes, open mouth, pain/shock expression"
    
    - issue: "Stable green light"
      problem: "Looks like a normal spell, not explosion"
      solution: "Burst effect, sparks flying, energy eruption"
    
    - issue: "No motion effects"
      problem: "Everything frozen, no sense of action"
      solution: "Motion blur, flying debris, wind effects"
    
    - issue: "Cape/hair static"
      problem: "No wind, no impact"
      solution: "Blown by explosion force, dramatic movement"

  # ========================================
  # REVISED COMPOSITION
  # ========================================
  revised_composition:
    key_concept: |
      This is NOT a "character holding a wand" picture.
      This is "the moment everything goes wrong" - 
      capture the INSTANT of explosion, shock, and tragedy.
    
    camera:
      angle: "dynamic angle, slightly tilted (Dutch angle)"
      position: "low angle, looking up at the explosion"
      focus: "explosion point with radial blur"
    
    character_pose:
      body: "recoiling backwards, thrown off balance by explosion"
      right_arm: "being pushed back by the blast, surrounded by green fire"
      left_arm: "thrown out for balance"
      legs: "one foot lifted, losing footing"
      head: "thrown back, looking at the explosion in shock"
    
    expression:
      eyes: "wide open in shock and disbelief"
      mouth: "open, screaming or gasping"
      overall: "the moment of 'this can't be happening'"
    
    effects:
      explosion:
        - "green energy BURSTING outward, not contained"
        - "sparks and fragments flying in all directions"
        - "shockwave rippling through the air"
        - "radial lines showing force of explosion"
      motion:
        - "motion blur on flying debris"
        - "speed lines"
        - "energy trails"
      cape_hair:
        - "cape blown violently by explosion force"
        - "hair whipping backwards"
        - "armor pieces rattling"
      environment:
        - "rain being pushed away by shockwave"
        - "ground cracking beneath"
        - "dust and debris in air"

  # DIRECTOR NOTES
  # ========================================
  director_notes: |
    The key to this illustration is CAPTURING A MOMENT IN TIME.
    
    Think of it like a freeze-frame from an action anime:
    - Everything is in motion, but frozen at the peak moment
    - The viewer should feel the FORCE of the explosion
    - The character should look like he's being HIT, not posing
    
    Reference: Think of explosion scenes from:
    - Fate/Zero (Saber's Excalibur backfiring)
    - Demon Slayer (impact frames)
    - My Hero Academia (quirk overload moments)
    
    The green light should feel WRONG and DANGEROUS,
    not like a cool power-up. It's a malfunction, a tragedy.
