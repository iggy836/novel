    Manga cover illustration, serious seinen/young adult style, dramatic and cinematic.
    
    Main Visual:
    - Center: A rugged craftsman (Granite, 32) standing in shadow, arms crossed, determined expression
    - His silhouette is backlit, creating strong rim lighting
    - Behind him: three symbolic elements overlapping:
      1. Workshop tools and half-finished wands (his craft)
      2. A massive white tower looming in the background (Royal Workshop - the antagonist)
      3. A small figure of a girl (Peridot) standing beside him, looking up with trust
    
    Composition:
    - Vertical format (manga cover proportions)
    - Granite dominates the center, taking up 60% of the frame
    - Strong diagonal composition creating tension
    - Title text placement: top 20% of cover
    - Episode number: bottom right corner
    
    Color Scheme:
    - Dark, moody palette
    - Deep blues and grays for shadows
    - Golden/orange rim lighting on Granite
    - White tower in background (intimidating contrast)
    - Green accent for Peridot's hair
    
    Typography Integration:
    - Title: "雨ノチ、杖暴発ス。所ニヨリ、職人ノ意地アリ" in bold, weathered font at top
    - Episode: "第4話：「孤立無援の職人」" in clean, professional font at bottom
    - Text should have subtle glow or shadow for readability
    
    Style: serious manga cover, detailed linework, dramatic shading, professional publication quality
