    Manga cover illustration, serious seinen/dark mystery style, dramatic and suspenseful.
    
    Main Visual:
    - Foreground (Left): Granite (rugged craftsman) and Peridot (small assistant) standing in shadows
    - Center-Right: Nerle (silver-haired designer) turning away, bathed in golden sunset light
    - Background: Massive Royal Workshop gate looming oppressively, creating strong vertical lines
    - Symbolic element: A green glowing light effect emanating from the background (mystery element)
    
    Composition:
    - Vertical format (manga cover proportions)
    - Strong diagonal divide: Dark left (Granite's side) vs Light right (Nerle/Workshop)
    - Visual weight: 40% craftsmen in shadow, 30% Nerle in light, 30% looming architecture
    - Title placement: top 20% with semi-transparent overlay
    - Episode number: bottom right corner
    
    Atmosphere:
    - Sense of isolation and broken trust
    - "Us vs Them" visual divide
    - Mystery and suspicion (green light motif)
    - Oppressive organizational power
    
    Color Scheme:
    - Left side: Deep blues, grays, and shadows (isolation)
    - Right side: Golden sunset oranges and warm light (deceptive beauty)
    - Nerle's silver hair catching the light
    - GREEN accent: mysterious glow in background (key plot element)
    - White Royal Workshop architecture (cold, imposing)
    
    Key Character Details:
    - Granite: Determined but desperate expression, clenched fists
    - Peridot: Small but defiant, stepping forward courageously
    - Nerle: Cold, conflicted, looking back over shoulder (torn loyalty)
    
    Typography Integration:
    - Title: "雨ノチ、杖暴発ス。所ニヨリ、職人ノ意地アリ" in bold font at top
    - Episode: "第5話：「緑光の疑惑」" in clean font at bottom
    - Green glow effect on "緑光" (green light) characters for emphasis
    
    Style: serious manga cover, detailed linework, dramatic lighting contrast, 
    professional publication quality, mystery/thriller aesthetic
