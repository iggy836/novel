title: "第1章 挿絵2：白亜の拒絶"
scene_id: ill_01_02
illustration_type: "serious anime style, overwhelming architecture"

prompt:
  main: |
    Serious anime illustration, EXTREME dramatic perspective emphasizing crushing power imbalance.
    CRITICAL: The tower must dominate 75-80% of the frame. Granite must be VERY SMALL.
    
    Camera Angle & Framing:
    - WORM'S EYE VIEW (extreme low angle, as if camera is on the ground)
    - Looking almost straight UP at the tower
    - Tower fills most of the vertical frame, stretching to the top
    - Granite occupies only the bottom 15-20% of frame
    - Strong perspective lines converging upward
    
    Characters:
    - Granite: SMALL figure at bottom of frame, seen from behind or side
      * Simplified details (more silhouette than detailed face)
      * Shoulders slumped, head tilted back looking up
      * Fists clenched at sides
      * Shadow cast on him from the building
      * DO NOT show detailed facial expression - keep him distant
    - Nerle: tiny figure barely visible in a high window
      * Silver hair just visible
      * Should be obviously far away
      * Almost symbolic rather than detailed
    
    Tower Composition:
    - MASSIVE white alabaster structure filling frame
    - Towering vertically, seemingly endless
    - Clean geometric architecture, overwhelming in its perfection
    - Sharp perspective lines all pointing upward
    - Multiple floors visible (at least 5-6 floors shown)
    - Nerle's window should be clearly high up (3rd-4th floor)
    
    Background & Environment:
    - Cold gray sky visible at top of frame
    - Ground/plaza at bottom (cobblestones or pavement)
    - Building casts long, dark shadow over Granite
    - Minimal other elements - focus on scale contrast
    
    Lighting:
    - Cold, harsh daylight
    - Tower is BRIGHT white, almost glowing
    - Ground and Granite are in deep shadow
    - Extreme contrast: bright tower vs dark ground
    - No warm tones - only cold blues, whites, grays
    
    Mood: crushing despair, absolute power difference, complete isolation, insurmountable wall
    Art style: serious anime, EXTREME perspective distortion, architectural intimidation
    
    AVOID: 
    - Granite being too large or detailed in the foreground
    - Equal framing of character and building
    - Warm, friendly colors
    - Eye-level perspective
