prompt_english: |
  A chilling vertical portrait illustration in realistic seinen manga and light novel art style.
  Inspired by Naoki Urasawa's MONSTER - Johan's unsettling smile.
  
  CAMERA ANGLE: Low angle, looking up at the man's face (from Granite's defeated viewpoint)
  
  CENTRAL FOCUS (80% of frame):
  CINNABAR - The False Saint
  - Elderly gentleman, late 50s to early 60s
  - Reddish silver-gray hair, neatly slicked back
  - Wearing luxurious black and crimson robes with gold trim
  - Ornate collar decoration showing his high rank
  
  FACIAL EXPRESSION - THE DUALITY:
  
  UPPER HALF OF FACE (in light):
  - Gentle, benevolent smile like a saint or priest
  - Soft, kind expression
  - Shallow laugh lines suggesting warmth
  - Bright, clear lighting from above
  
  LOWER HALF OF FACE (in shadow):
  - The smile continues but becomes unsettling in shadow
  - Slight asymmetry making smile look wrong
  - Darkness pooling around jawline and neck
  
  THE EYES - MOST CRITICAL:
  - Eyes completely cold, emotionless, dead
  - Sharp contrast with smiling mouth
  - Pupils slightly dilated, predatory
  - No warmth whatsoever in the gaze
  - Calculating, manipulative intelligence
  - Cold blue highlights in the eyes
  - "The eyes of someone who has never felt true compassion"
  
  HAND GESTURE:
  - Hands spread in open, placating gesture
  - "I want to help, but I can't" - theatrical sympathy
  - Well-manicured hands, no calluses
  - Gesture looks rehearsed, performative
  
  FOREGROUND (bottom 20%):
  - Silhouette of GRANITE's shoulders and back of head
  - Hunched, defeated posture
  - Slightly out of focus
  - Dark silhouette against the lit figure above
  
  LIGHTING - CRUCIAL TO THE DUALITY:
  - Light from above illuminating top half of face
  - Shadow falling across lower half and neck
  - Creates literal "two-faced" appearance
  - Clean separation between light and dark
  - Slight backlight creating halo effect (false angel)
  
  BACKGROUND:
  - Soft blur, unimportant
  - Muted workshop interior
  - All focus on the face
  
  SYMBOLIC ELEMENTS:
  - Light/Dark split = Two-faced nature
  - Smile = The mask of benevolence
  - Cold eyes = True cruel nature
  - Hand gesture = Performance of caring
  - Halo effect = False divinity
  
  ATMOSPHERE:
  - Deeply unsettling, uncanny valley
  - "Something is very wrong with this person"
  - Creeping dread, manipulation
  - Sweet poison, velvet glove hiding iron fist
  - Gaslighting incarnate
  
  EMOTIONAL TONE:
  - Reader should feel: disgust, unease, anger, dread
  - "This is the real villain"
  - Worse than physical violence - psychological cruelty
  - "He's enjoying this"
  
  COLOR PALETTE:
  - Black, crimson, gold (robes - authority, wealth)
  - Pale skin tones
  - Cool blue in eyes (inhuman coldness)
  - Warm light above, cool shadow below
  
  CRITICAL DETAILS:
  - The disconnect between smile and eyes must be OBVIOUS
  - Eyes should make viewer uncomfortable
  - Lighting must create clear upper/lower split
  - Smooth, practiced expression - this is his weapon
  
  ART STYLE REFERENCES:
  - Naoki Urasawa's MONSTER - Johan's smile
  - Psychological horror portraiture
  - Realistic, detailed facial anatomy
  - Professional light novel quality
  - Seinen manga sensibility
  
  VERBAL CONTEXT (for mood):
  He's saying: "I'm sorry, but there's no evidence. I can't help you."
  While thinking: "You're trapped and I'm enjoying watching you squirm."
  
  TECHNICAL SPECS:
  - Vertical/portrait composition
  - MAXIMUM detail on facial expression, especially eyes
  - Shallow depth of field (background and foreground blurred)
  - Careful lighting to create the split personality effect
  - Cold highlights in eyes essential
  - No text or speech bubbles
  - Publication quality
