  RIGHT SIDE (40% of frame):
  NELL - The Inspector
  - Petite woman in early 30s, silver hair, sharp teal eyes
  - Standing perfectly straight, not flinching despite size difference
  - Pristine white Royal Workshop uniform, not a wrinkle
  - Arms at sides or lightly crossed
  - Looking up at the giant man without fear
  - Expression of cold contempt, lips curved in disdainful smile
  - Eyes sharp and calculating, full of superiority
  - Clean, bright lighting on her - no shadows
  - Emanating quiet authority despite being half his size
  
  BACKGROUND (20% of frame):
  - Elderly man (CINNABAR) in black/crimson robes

  Size: Giant vs Petite
  Color: Brown/dirty (work clothes) vs Pure white (uniform)
  Posture: Aggressive lean vs Rigid straight
  Light: Dark shadows vs Clean light
  Emotion: Hot anger vs Cold contempt
  
  SYMBOLIC ELEMENTS:
  - His pointing finger = Craftsman's accusation, hand-worked truth

  ATMOSPHERE:

  - Field experience vs Academic theory
  - Passion vs Logic
  - "I WORKED on it with my hands!" vs "The DATA is perfect!"
  
  COLOR PALETTE:

  - Cool side (Nell): Whites, silvers, blues, clinical tones
  - Background: Muted workshop colors
